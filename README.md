## Update guide

In order to update the website to the latest version, you need to download the latest release, copy the content of the new `src/apache2/src/` in your own `apache2/src/` directory.

:warning: If you don't want all your work to be lost, don't copy:   
- .htaccess   
- articles/   
- favicon.png   
- website.conf.php   
- sitemap.json   

New options may be needed in your `website.conf.php` file. Check the release changelog in order to update your configuration file consequently (if you are updating from the upstream git, check the commit messages).
