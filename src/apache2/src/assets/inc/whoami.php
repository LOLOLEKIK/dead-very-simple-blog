<h2 id="about-me" style="padding-top: 20px">‚úí About me.</h2>
<p>Hello, i'm a French cybersecurity student and developer who love to learn new things.</p>
<p>I have done a lot of development projects, especially with PHP in the past.<br>
Now I am more into low level languages like C or assembly.</p>
<p>I also like to learn some new stuff, I recently started kernel development which is really interesting and SDL2 to make some 2D multiplatform graphic apps.</p>

<h4>üîß Ricing Linux</h4>
<p>As I use Linux as my primary operating system, I went through the fundamental question: which distribution uses?</p>
<p>From this, I have started customizing my new fresh Debian install by installing from scratch the X Server, Window Manager, notifications deamon et cetera. Dealing with config files and stuff like that.</p>
<p>Today, I am still improving my skills in this domain and that's partly what made me decide to write my own kernel.</p>

<h4>üíª CTFs</h4>
<p>Since I heard about what cybersecurity is (fight against the black hats to protect important data, etc...), I thought it was super cool and so I made my mind and started doing CTFs</p>
<p>Those are pretty fun games where you need to break into a system or bypass some security to get beloved flags.<br>
Root Me is a famous French website who does those kind of things.</p>

<h4>üïπ Video Games</h4>
<p>I sometimes manage to play games. I love to play at some rhythm games like Osu! or StepMania.</p>
<p>Recently, one of my friends initiated me to the Final fantasy series so I started playing FF9 which is a very cool game!</p>
